## Simulators in Detail

Automata-Verse provides a comprehensive suite of simulators covering the most important computational models in automata theory:

### Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)
The DFA simulator allows you to:
- Create and edit states with intuitive drag-and-drop interface
- Define transitions between states with labeled edges
- Set initial and accepting states
- Test input strings with step-by-step visualization
- See immediate validation of your automaton design
- Export and share your creations

### Nondeterministic Finite Automaton (NFA)
Our NFA simulator extends the DFA capabilities with:
- Support for epsilon (Îµ) transitions
- Visualization of multiple active states simultaneously
- Animation of parallel state transitions
- Step-by-step tracing of all possible computation paths
- Conversion between NFA and DFA representations

### Pushdown Automaton (PDA)
The PDA simulator includes:
- Visual stack representation that updates in real-time
- Support for stack operations (push, pop)
- Step-by-step animation of stack changes
- Clear visualization of how the stack influences state transitions
- Detailed breakdowns of computation steps

### Turing Machine (TM)
Our most powerful simulator offers:
- Multi-tape support for complex algorithms
- Intuitive visualization of tape contents
- Step-by-step execution with tape movement animation
- Support for user-defined transition functions
- Ability to create, save, and load complex Turing Machines
- Customizable tape alphabet and state set

Each simulator features a consistent user interface making it easy to transition between different computational models while learning the unique capabilities and constraints of each.
